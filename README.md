# landing-page
I am currently working on creating my first webpage with a general reference with how it should look and be styled. I hope to successfully demonstrate my HTML and CSS knowledge that I've acquired up until now.
Edit: 
I think I'm dying doing this project, I'm barely editing the css with the first chunk and I am STRUGGLING. 

Edit-2: 
Alright so once I finished with the first chunk, everything has come a lot easier. I haven't gotten to the very last part yet, but for now I'm doing okay!

Edit-3:
So the third part with the quote did trip me up a lot and it took me hours to realize the simple solution. I have finally finished everything and I'm happy to say I actually did include some live links to my Instagram! Most are dead but I do plan to revisit when I have more things to add!
